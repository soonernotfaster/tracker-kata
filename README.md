# Tracker in React


## Developer setup

There is a `devcontainer`, but save your money by running it locally using Docker.

This repo uses the [Scripts to Rule Them All](https://github.blog/engineering/scripts-to-rule-them-all/) pattern, where applicable.
This allows `uv` dependencies to instal on container start.

1. In VS Code install [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
1. Clone the repo
1. Open the repo using the "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container" command in VS Code
